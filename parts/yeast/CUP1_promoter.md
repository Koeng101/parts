Promoter region of the CUP1 gene encoding a copper-binding metallothionein in S. cerevisiae. This promoter is strongly induced by copper ions and provides tight regulation. In the yeast toolkit, 55 fold induction was observed, but 7 fold fluorescence over background, showing leaky expression, likely due to CuSO4 present at 250nM in yeast defined media.
